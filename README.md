# SQL_EDITOR_APP
The page load time of my app was at an average of App(0.8ms of 2.1ms).
I calculated the page load time by going to my React Developer tools, went to the tab "Profiler" and clicked on the "record button" which is "blue" in color.
While it was recording, I was running the app and using to dropdown to pick a particular product id and once I picked the product id, it populates 
the rest of the table with the neccessary information.
I did that activity 5 times and I stopped recording, immediately after that the "Profiler" showed me my page load time with 5 different load times:
Rendered at: 0.8ms of 2.1ms, 0.8ms of 1.8ms, 0.7ms of 1.5ms, 0.7ms of 2.9ms, 0.8ms of 1.7ms
Rendered Duration: 1.7ms
